# survexpress
This repository contains the original script for running web-based, server-side pre-processed cancer data.

The script then needs a server, R, R-libraries, and pre-processed databases to run properly.

The script is based on updates of a basic 2013 and 2015 script.

An update is planned (SurvExpress 2.0) for more cancer datasets, other diseases, and "on the fly" analyses.

We are applying for funds to make this possible.

Original SurvExpress is running at:
